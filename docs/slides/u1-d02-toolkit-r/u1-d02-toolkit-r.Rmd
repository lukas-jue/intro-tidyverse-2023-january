## R and RStudio

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="25%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/r-logo.png")
```
- R is an open-source statistical **programming language**
- R is also an environment for statistical computing and graphics
- It's easily extensible with *packages*
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio-logo.png")
```
- RStudio is a convenient interface for R called an **IDE** (integrated development environment), e.g. *"I write R code in the RStudio IDE"*
- RStudio is not a requirement for programming with R, but it's very commonly used by R programmers and data scientists
]

## R packages

- **Packages** are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data<sup>1</sup>

- As of January 2022, there are over 18,000 R packages available on **CRAN** (the Comprehensive R Archive Network)<sup>2</sup>

- We're going to work with a small (but important) subset of these!

<sup>2</sup> [CRAN contributed packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/).

## Tour: R and RStudio

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tour-r-rstudio.png")
```

---

## A short list (for now) of R essentials

- Functions are (most often) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parentheses:

```{r eval=FALSE}
do_this(to_this)
do_that(to_this, to_that, with_those)
```

--

- Packages are installed with the `install.packages` function and loaded with the `library` function, once per session:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("package_name")
library(package_name)
```

---

## R essentials (continued)

- Columns (variables) in data frames are accessed with `$`:


```{r eval=FALSE}
dataframe$var_name
```


--

- Object documentation can be accessed with `?`

```{r eval=FALSE}
?mean
```

---

## tidyverse

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="99%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tidyverse.png")
```
]

.pull-right[
.center[.large[
[tidyverse.org](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
]]

- The **tidyverse** is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science
- All packages share an underlying philosophy and a common grammar
]

---

## rmarkdown

.pull-left[
.center[.large[
[rmarkdown.rstudio.com](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
]]

- **rmarkdown** and the various packages that support it enable R users to write their code and prose in reproducible computational documents
- We will generally refer to R Markdown documents (with `.Rmd` extension), e.g. *"Do this in your R Markdown document"* and rarely discuss loading the rmarkdown package
]

.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}

# R Markdown

## R Markdown

- Fully reproducible reports â€” each time you knit the analysis runs from the beginning
- Simple markdown syntax for text
- Code goes in chunks, defined by three backticks, narrative goes outside of chunks

---

## Tour: R Markdown

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tour-rmarkdown.png")
```

---

## Environments

.tip[
The environment of your R Markdown document is separate from the Console!
]

Remember this, and expect it to bite you a few times as you're learning to work 
with R Markdown!

---

## Environments

.pull-left[
First, run the following in the console

.small[
```{r eval = FALSE}
x <- 2
x * 3
```
]

.question[
All looks good, eh?
]
]

--

.pull-right[
Then, add the following in an R chunk in your R Markdown document

.small[
```{r eval = FALSE}
x * 3
```
]

.question[
What happens? Why the error?
]
]

---

## R Markdown help

.pull-left[
.center[
.midi[R Markdown Cheat Sheet  
`Help -> Cheatsheets`]
]
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rmd-cheatsheet.png")
```
]
.pull-right[
.center[
.midi[Markdown Quick Reference  
`Help -> Markdown Quick Reference`]
]
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/md-cheatsheet.png")
```
]

---

## How will we use R Markdown?

- Every application exercise is an R Markdown document
- You'll always have a template R Markdown document to start with
- The amount of scaffolding in the template will decrease over the course

.your-turn[
.light-blue[.hand[Your turn:]] `Application Exercise 02 - Bechdel + R Markdown`
- [The Bechdel test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test) asks whether a work of fiction features at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man, and there must be two women named characters.
- Go to [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/) and start the assignment `application-exercise-02-bechdel-test-rmarkdown`. 
- Open and knit the R Markdown document `bechdel.Rmd`, review the document, and try to fill in the blanks.
