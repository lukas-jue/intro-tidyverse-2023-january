## Data science

.pull-left-wide[
- Data science is an exciting discipline that allows you to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge. 

- We're going to learn to do this in a `tidy` way -- more on that later!

- This is a course on introduction to data science in `R` and the `tidyverse` packages.

## Course FAQ

.pull-left-wide[
**Q - What data science/programming background does this course assume?**  
A - None.

**Q - Is this a course for neuroscientists only?**  
A - Yes and no. While this course is exclusively for GRADE Brain and other GRADE Centers,
the course does not introduce you to neuroscience applications with `R`.
Rather, we will discuss some computational tools that most scientists share
and which are applicable beyond your field.

**Q - Will we be doing computing?**   
A - Yes. Do as much as possible by yourself — that's how you learn it.

# Course FAQ (2/2)

.pull-left-wide[
**Q - Where do I find the course materials?**

A - On this website: [lukas-jue.github.io/intro-tidyverse-2023-january/](https://lukas-jue.github.io/intro-tidyverse-2023-january/)

**Q - Can I code on my own during this course?**

A - Yes! You can and you should! Go to [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/) (formerly RStudio Cloud) for your development environment and our application exercises.

# Is it possible to learn all that in this course?

.pull-left-wide[
Yes — if you're actively coding along and invest some time.

We'll go through every step in this course:
-	Plotting with `ggplot2` 
-	Data wrangling with `dplyr`
-	Communicating your results with `R Markdown`
- Regressions with `tidymodels`
